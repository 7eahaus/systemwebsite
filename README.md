# TeaHaus System Website
Welcome to the repository for the TeaHaus System website! If you don't know what a system is, find out more [here](https://whatisdid.com).
This repository is for building ourselves a unique website with multiple pages that will later be hosted at "7eahaus.systems" and, in its final form, will feature a page for each alter.

## Rules
As a member of the TeaHaus system, you can feel free to code your own page! If that's not your thing, ask Everest or Bernie to code it for you and we'd be happy to help. If you'd like anything specific on your page, feel free to note it under your reserved section below. Please do not delete or otherwise mess with another alter's code or page unless given explicit permission to do so.

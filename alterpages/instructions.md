# Instructions for Making Your Page
1. Make the webpage responsive to different screen sizes.
2. Make the webpage easily accessible by screenreaders using alt text.
3. Do not code your webpage using purely AI. You may use AI to help you, but you must understand what you're coding when you make your site. If you can't understand, ask Bernie or Everest to take a look at it.

Other than this, you have pretty much free reign over your page! Don't be afraid to ask for help!
